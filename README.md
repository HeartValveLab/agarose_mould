### Changing mould parameters
You can either change the parameters directly in the code, or use OpenSCAD's part customizer.

To enable the customization view uncheck *Hide Customizer* from the *Window* menu.
* Change parameters to taste


### Export the mould for 3D printing
* Generate final render: press the *Render* button (shortcut: *F6*)
* Export the final model as .stl: press the *Export as STL* button (shortcut: *F7*).
The first time you export, it can take up to a few minutes; grab yourself a coffee.
